# Akeneo for Mac (using Docker)

## GOAL

The main goal is to easily manage your differents PIMs already installed on your MAC in order to avoid the usage of the command line for usual testing.

For example:
- Boot a PIM
- Open a PIM in Browser
- Shutdown a PIM
- Initialize a PIM
- ...

The second goal is to install new PIMs on your mac to replace this bash script https://github.com/anaelChardan/AkeneoTools/tree/master/pim-installer

Feel free to give your ideas :-)
